# SPLASH CHAT ⚡️

## Created A Chat App with below features:

- Welcome Screen
- Login/Registration Screen with a simple Firebase Backend that enables users to Sign In or Sign Up. If you are a first time user Enter a Email and password to Sign Up. You can Sign In again using the same credentials.
- Chat List Screen with a list of Friends, their last message, last seen time, and Active Status
- Profile Screen where Name is editable 
- A static Message Box just for demonstration purpose with few sample messages and an input text field (since creating Backend wasn’t part of requirement)
- A drawer with Dark Mode/Light Mode switching option and Logout option
